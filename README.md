A magical place where the unbelievable happens.

## Jason's Project 1 - Black Jack Game
Over the last two weeks we have absorbed a plethora of information about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project I will be applying the skills I have learned to create a Black Jack game 

## Objectives
-Build a Black Jack game in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Use best practices when writing code, DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) code is always a better option
- Create a portfolio worthy project with my own personal style

## Reference Resources - Example of What I'll Be Building
- [Basic Example](https://codepen.io/eqmvii/pen/GmRmZa)

## Getting Started
- First fork and clone this repository.
- Create an `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` folders.
- I'll run `open index.html` to open your game in the browser (Mac).
- I'll be working in the `index.html` file, `app.js` in the `js` folder, and `style.css` in the `css` folder.

## Requirements
- A user will be issued "$100" game credit.
- User should choose how much of their credit to wager with a "$10" minimum bet and "$1000" maximum bet.
- Deck will shuffle.
- U will be given two shown cards values from the deck, and computer will be given one "face up" card value and one "face down" card value to begin.
- User must be able to click one of two options to "Hit" or to "Stay".
- If user's card value goes above 21, user "breaks" and loses.
- If computer's card value goes above 21, the computer "breaks" and loses.
- If neither player "breaks", Game will detect conditions and display winner who's value is closest to 21.
- Game will debit or distribute credit accordingly.
- Black JAck pays 2 to 1.
- Reset button to shuffle deck and play another hand.


## Bonuses
- Make this game actually work.
- Make if look so good with CSS styling that it's something I'm proud to show off.
- Essentially shmurder the project objectives and go above and beyond.
- Add a "Lucky Ladies" extra wager option for player to bet if his initial cards will be suited and "Queens", pays 10 to 1.
